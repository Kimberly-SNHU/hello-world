This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

Hello, my name is Kimberly. I’m 27 years old and a proud mom of two boys, ages nine and 18 months. (Yes, there’s quite an age gap—but my oldest is wonderful with his baby brother and absolutely adores him.)

I’m currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering at Southern New Hampshire University. Going back to school has been a goal of mine for a few years now, especially once I realized I wanted to build a career in technology. It hasn’t been an easy road—life has thrown plenty of obstacles my way—but this past year I decided it was time to push through and make it happen.

I chose this path for several reasons. Growing up in the age of technology, I’ve always been fascinated by how it works—not just the parts we see, but the coding, development, and problem-solving behind it all. So far, I’ve gained experience with CSS and Python, I’m currently learning Java, and I’ve also taken a Data Analytics course.

Beyond my interest in tech, I also want a career that gives me the flexibility to spend more time with my family. Right now, I work full time while also being a full-time student, and I’m highly motivated to succeed in this program for both my personal growth and my family’s future.

Thank you for taking the time to read my introduction.
